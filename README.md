# 100-days-of-JAVA
100 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.  After two failed attempts, I'm coming back by publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today!  I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:  Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag My Exceptions:  If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day My Community work, and few emergencies demands to take a day off



```Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.```

```Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., where James Gosling led a team of researchers in an effort to create a new language that would allow consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other. Work on the language began in 1991, and before long the team's focus changed to a new niche, the World Wide Web.```
